# Dix

Dix is a simple interpreted programming language written in C, based on the bytecode VM. It was created as a learning project to better understand how programming languages work. I had some problems with static typing in [my previous take](https://www.github.com/badzianga/pudel) on the language based on tree-walk interpreter, so I'm playing with VM this time.

Dix is inspired by "Crafting Interpreters" book by Robert Nystrom, from where I learned basics about creating own interpreters.
